Backorder Prediction for Optimal Inventory Management
Project Overview:
In the dynamic landscape of manufacturing and distribution, preventing backorders
is crucial for maintaining customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. This
machine learning project aims to develop a predictive model that anticipates the
likelihood of a product going on backorder. By leveraging historical data, the
model will empower businesses to make informed inventory management
decisions, ultimately minimizing backorders and optimizing the supply chain.
Key Components:
1. Data Collection:
- Historical data will be collected, encompassing SKU information, inventory
levels, lead times, forecasts, sales data, and backorder status.
2. Backorder Prediction:
- Develop a robust predictive model to estimate the probability of a product
going on backorder based on historical data. This involves the application of
machine learning algorithms for classification.
3. Inventory Optimization:
- Utilize the predictions to optimize inventory levels, reorder points, and lead
times. This ensures that inventory is replenished strategically, minimizing the risk
of backorders while avoiding excess stock.
4. Operational Decision-Making:
- The model's predictions will guide procurement, production, and distribution
decisions. By proactively triggering restocking when necessary, the system will
prevent backorders and maintain smooth operations.
5. Customer Satisfaction:
- The ultimate goal is to enhance customer satisfaction by ensuring product
availability. Minimizing backorders not only prevents revenue loss but also fosters
a positive customer experience.
Scope:
The project encompasses the entire machine learning pipeline:
- Data processing and cleaning.
- Feature engineering to extract relevant information.
- Model development using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.
- Model comparison to identify the most effective solution.
Key Metrics:
1. Accuracy:
- Measure the model's ability to correctly classify products at risk of backorders.
2. Precision and Recall:
- Evaluate the trade-off between accuracy and false alarms, ensuring the model's
reliability.
3. AUC-ROC Score:
- Assess the overall performance of the model in distinguishing between products
at risk of backorder and those that are not.
Impact:
Addressing the backorder challenge directly enhances supply chain efficiency,
reduces operational costs, and significantly improves the customer experience. By
preventing backorders, businesses can maintain a competitive edge and ensure the
availability of products, thereby maximizing customer satisfaction and preventing
revenue loss.
